Your monthly instalments will include interest charged at 20.75%, delivery fees of 9% and a facility account initiation and service fee. Delivery charges for furniture clients are charged at 11% (to a maximum of R860). Assembly fees may also apply.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>INTERNATIONAL DELIVERY FEE:</strong> Orders from Namibia and Botswana have a delivery fee of 15% of the cash 
                            price. Orders from Lesotho and Swaziland have a delivery fee of 25% of the cash price. Zambian 
                            orders include additional delivery fees payable to Mercury Couriers. International tax is charged 
                            as follows: Namibia – 16.5% of the credit price; Botswana – 12% of the credit price.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>MONTHLY SERVICE FEE:</strong> A monthly service fee (currently R29.25) will be charged to your account plus an 
                            additional R10.10 monthly service fee if you use both the Flexi and the Advantage accounts. Using the 
                            Advantage account is optional and fees for this account will only be charged if you decide to use 
                            it.

                            <strong>FACILITY ACCOUNT INITIATION AND SERVICE FEE:</strong> The facility account initiation and service fee is made up of an initiation fee and an annual service fee, but we 
                            do not immediately add it to your outstanding balance. The initiation fee portion of the facility account initiation and service fee is charged proportionately 
                            between the Flexi and Advantage facility accounts. The facility account initiation and service fee will be charged up to a maximum of 10% of the price of the goods or services 
                            each time you purchase and will be added to the outstanding balance on a pro-rata basis each time you buy until the full fee has been paid. This fee will never exceed the 
                            maximum fees allowed in terms of the National Credit Act. Certain payment providers charge a payment service fee each time you use them to pay your account. 
                            The payment service fee is charged at R7.40 per payment and this amount will be deducted from your payment each time you use this payment method. 
                            The payment service fee is included in the credit costs and is not charged in addition to these.

                        <p>
                            <strong>ACCOUNT INITIATION FEE:</strong> A once-off account initiation fee (R100 including VAT) will be charged on the day you open your Flexi account. 
                            This fee is not additional to the fees charged in terms of the NCA and will be deducted from the total facility account initiation and service fee due. 
                            The fee will be added to your principle debt with payments spread across the terms of your purchase.

                            for a while, you will need to answer some questions about your income and expenses. We will ask you to send us documents to confirm your income such as: your last three months' bank statements, payslips or pension slips, OR a completed Proof of Income form.

                            <strong>Credit cost multiple</strong><br>
                            This shows you how much more you pay, in total, over the agreed payment terms when you buy on credit and is calculated as the total cost of credit divided by the principle debt for the item ordered.
